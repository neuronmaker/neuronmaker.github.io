			<h2>Efficiency</h2>
			<p>Efficiency seems to be overlooked by many in my field. As computers get faster and cheaper,
			the temptation to ignore performance grows. When working on large programs, games, or anything with a
			battery, performance starts to matter. I firmly believe that most of our wasted performance today is due
			to negligent programming, and programmer training that teaches inefficient habits.</p>
			<p>I learned both how to write efficient code, and its value when working on the back end of a group project.
			Our class was full of slow and buggy Chess programs. Our program was also buggy and slow until I rewrote the
			engine. The biggest and cheapest performance gain was from asking myself "What is the minimum amount of
			information this function needs?". As a bonus, streamlining the code for efficiency also fixed most of the
			bugs, and made our codebase considerably smaller and easier to read.</p>

		<div class="contentCard">
			<h2>Code readability</h2>
			<p>Code is only valuable as long as someone can read and understand it. Everything I write is written with
			the assumption that I will need to re-write it, modify it, or show someone else how to make said code work.</p>
			<p>The right attitude is where one must start. Writing with kindness and courtesy towards the next set of eyes
			on a piece of code will lead learning and practicing good coding and documentation practices.</p>
