		<h2>Email</h2> <p>Email is the preferred contact method for many people.</p>
		<p>My main email address is <a href="mailto:neuronmaker@gmail.com">neuronmaker@gmail.com</a></p>
		<p>Please be respectful with my email address.</p>

		<h2>Signal</h2> <p>My Signal username is: <code>neuronmaker.94</code></p>
		<p>Signal is one of the most popular secure messengers. It is very similar to WhatsApp, but
		operated in a more trustworthy manner.</p>
		<p>Signal has recently added usernames as a substitute for a phone number.</p>
		<p>Get Signal from their <a href="https://signal.org/download/">website.</a></p>

		<h2>Session</h2> <p>Session is a private and secure instant messenger, similar in function to WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage.</p>
		<p>My Session ID is: <code>0598642b0838ea87aa04ca7a584e9515f1131de64e15a043ab71ddfdc9ff26566e</code></p>
		<p>To get Session, go to the <a href="https://getsession.org/download">Session website</a>. Session is designed
		for strong security, privacy, and anonymity. It also does not require a phone number.</p>

		<h2>OpenPGP</h2>
		<p>My OpenPGP key fingerprints are listed below:<br>
		Primary key (Ed25519): <code>1F32 5206 DE34 CFCF 0022 D045 48A7 3B8C 8920 7930</code><br>
		Backup key (RSA4096): <code>167E 19AC B8E5 38F3 2FD2 2766 81C9 678A 0987 8230</code></p>
		<p>OpenPGP is one of the few ways to secure email messages, and it's used by GitHub in order to
		verify that a developer really is who they say they are. It's an older system, but is still in use by some.</p>
		<p>I publish two public keys, one based on the RSA technology, and one that uses the newer Ed25519 technology.
		The difference lies in size and compatibility, RSA is less efficient but more compatible due to its age,
		and Ed25519 is more efficient due to using newer elliptic curve based math. Some older services lack support
		for elliptic curves.</p>
		<p>Both my keys are considered valid, but only use the RSA based key if your system does not
		work with Ed25519. If you have not heard of this system before, this is a common way that software developers
		digitally sign their work and prove their identity. Digital signatures are used to protect against unauthorized
		tampering or impersonation.</p>
		<p>My public key files can be downloaded from <a href="https://keybase.io/neuronmaker#show-public">Keybase.io</a> or
			GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/neuronmaker/neuronmaker/blob/main/neuronmaker-publickey.asc">Primary key</a>,
			<a href="https://github.com/neuronmaker/neuronmaker/blob/main/neuronmaker-publickey-secondary.asc">Backup key</a>)</p>
